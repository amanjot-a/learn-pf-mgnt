# 📊 Learn Portfolio Management – Risk & Return

> A hands-on learning project to understand **risk, return, and portfolio theory** using Python, real data, and visualizations.

---

## 📌 What This Project Is About
While studying portfolio management, I found concepts like **efficient frontier**, **risk measures**, and **investor preferences** difficult to grasp from theory alone.  
This project uses **Python-based visualizations** (with AI assistance) to make these ideas intuitive and practical.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Risk vs Return trade-off  
- Efficient Frontier & Capital Allocation Line  
- Indifference Curves (investor preferences)  
- Skewness of return distributions  
- CAPM, Sharpe Ratio, and risk decomposition  

---

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔹 Python Scripts
- **EfficientFrontier.py** – Efficient Frontier & CAL visualization  
- **IndifferenceCurve.py** – Investor indifference curves  
- **Skewness.py** – Skewness analysis of returns  
- **SBIportfolio.py** – Portfolio risk analysis, CAPM & report generation  

### 🔹 Data & Outputs
- **SBI Historical Data.xlsx** – Historical asset prices  
- **Market.xlsx** – Market benchmark data  
- **SBI_Risk_Report.xlsx** – Generated risk analysis report  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Excel
- AI-assisted visualization for learning support

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This is a **learning-focused project** created to build intuition around portfolio risk and return using real data and graphs.
